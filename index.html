      <h3>Project 1</h3>
      <p>The COVID-19 Survival Prediction Project develops a machine learning model to estimate survival probabilities for COVID-19 patients using demographic and clinical data such as age, symptoms, and comorbidities. By preprocessing data, selecting key features, and training models like XGBoost or random forests, the project aims to provide precise, actionable predictions. These insights assist healthcare providers in prioritizing patients and managing resources effectively. Addressing challenges like data quality, bias mitigation, and interpretability ensures reliability. Ultimately, the project enhances decision-making during pandemics, improving patient outcomes and supporting healthcare systems in critical situations.</p>

      <h3>Project 2</h3>
      <p>The **Customer Churn Prediction Project** focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict whether customers are likely to leave a service or product subscription. Using datasets with features like demographic information, transaction history, and engagement metrics, the project preprocesses data, selects key features, and trains models like logistic regression or gradient boosting. The goal is to provide actionable insights to identify at-risk customers and implement retention strategies. Challenges include handling imbalanced data, ensuring interpretability, and adapting to changing customer behaviors. This project helps businesses reduce churn, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize long-term profitability by proactively addressing customer needs.</p>
